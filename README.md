Brute force` - using three for loops inside each other <br> `2. Better approach` - Used the hashmap (map) to find the sum and checking if sum-k is present int the map if it is then recalculating the length of the subarray. used the ` mpp[sum] = i` that is setting the sum as key and index as value <br>`3. Optimum approach` - used the two pointer approach, continue to move the right pointer and add its value to sum. if the sum == k then move the left pointer from the left-- and sub the value from the sum and recalculate the length |

O(2n) 3. approach was using this dutch national flag algorithm                                                                                                                                     |

<details>
we can also return the positions of the sub array by taking three variables `start, ansStart, ansEnd` , assign the start = i if the sum = 0 and if the global max is being updated assign the ansStart = start and ansEnd = i ( that is current index)
